## Installation

Install the *`dailydose`* module with `pip`.


## Usage

Once installed, *`dailydose`* gives access to the package's 4 special features: today's news in different fields (per Vox Media), random fun facts, and the games of hangman and battleship. The variety of the collection is inspired by the traditional newspaper/magazine experience, in which both information and thought-provoking entertainment is regularly provided. This package is ideal for any program that operates on changing content or stimulating applications. 

*dailydose* supports a command-line interface (CLI). To choose one of the above options, simply call:

```
$ python3 -m dailydose

Upon running the package, a main menu is displayed in which your options are listed. Access each feature by entering their corresponding menu number.
